testcase

This testcase module should deploy the contents of the `data/deployment.yaml` to
a base directory (/opt/testcase) that should be able to be defined. Each site
should be installed under a `sites/` subdirectory with a `current/` symlink to the
current version deployed. The components should be deployed under a `components/`
subdirectory and the version of the component the site requires symlinked.

The final directory try should look something along the lines of that shown in
the `Deployment` file. The components & sites sub-directory names are static but the
base directory can change as will the site names and component names. The whole module
should be able to handle any number of sites with any number of components declared.
